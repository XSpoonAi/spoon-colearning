# Co-Learning


Large Language Models (LLMs) have profoundly reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence. This course is designed to guide learners through the **core principles of LLMs and intelligent agents**, combining theoretical foundations with hands-on experience.

We will explore:
- The **architecture and capabilities** of large language models
- The **key features** needed to automate real-world tasks
- The **underlying framework** for building and deploying agent systems

In addition to foundational knowledge, we will delve into **practical applications**, including:
- Code generation
- Robotic control
- Web process automation

We will also examine the **limitations and risks** of current LLM agents â€” such as hallucination, misalignment, and brittleness â€” and discuss how future systems might address these challenges.


## Topics Covered

 ðŸ”¹ Foundation of LLMs  
 ðŸ”¹ LLM Inference & Reasoning          
 ðŸ”¹ Agent Overview (Planning â€“ Tool Use â€“ Memory)       
 ðŸ”¹ MCP (Modular Control Protocol) & A2A (Agent-to-Agent communication)

        <strong>Inference:</strong><br>
        - What are the inputs and outputs of an LLM model?<br>
        - Difference between pre-filling and auto-regressive decoding<br>
        - Auto-regressive decoding:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- How are tokens sampled based on output<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- What are top-k, top-p, temperature?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- How does the LLM know when to stop?<br><br>

        <strong>Reasoning:</strong><br>
        - What is reasoning in its fundamental sense?<br>
        - Why reasoning is important for LLM?<br>
        - Two approaches of achieving reasoning:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Using a fine-tuned model<br>
