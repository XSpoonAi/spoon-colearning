# Co-Learning

Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally reshaped numerous fields. This course will explore the core principles of LLM and Agents, covering the foundations of LLM, key LLM features required to automate tasks, and the underlying framework for agent creation. We will also delve into specific applications of agents, such as code generation, robot control, and web process automation. At the same time, we will explore the limitations and inherent risks of current LLM agents and look forward to future improvements.
