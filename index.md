# Co-Learning


Large Language Models (LLMs) have profoundly reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence. This course is designed to guide learners through the **core principles of LLMs and intelligent agents**, combining theoretical foundations with hands-on experience.

We will explore:
- The **architecture and capabilities** of large language models
- The **key features** needed to automate real-world tasks
- The **underlying framework** for building and deploying agent systems

In addition to foundational knowledge, we will delve into **practical applications**, including:
- Code generation
- Robotic control
- Web process automation

We will also examine the **limitations and risks** of current LLM agents â€” such as hallucination, misalignment, and brittleness â€” and discuss how future systems might address these challenges.
